My thoughts on the class is that its pretty difficult just to try and make a blog. I have learned how to make blogs and web pages in just a couple of dyas and its simply and hard at the same time. My biggest challenge was when i got stuck with making a folder, but it was easy to solve since all I had to do was slash before the file.
Either way I am very exicted to see what else I can do in this class, such as programming and with html.
