Thsi week we mostly learned the range of a circle and the range is the image and if we do a function that produces circle it will ahve a range because it is its size so when we change that range it would either increase or decrease depending on the number that is given like 20 the circle would be small while if it were 100 it would be a bigger circle. Another thing we learned more about was contracts and how they give an agreement to computers on what they expect and they give back what we expect.
