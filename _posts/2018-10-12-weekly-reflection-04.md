Ok so in this week we learned about many things like how to put shapes in wescheme which leads to me thinking that this is how we will make our game later on. Its been a challenge because most of the coding that allows the image to show is extremely difficult. Since most of the code doesnt show sometimes its probably because most of the time me and my partner probably missed something. Either way its fun to code and program these images to appear and I like a challenge so class has been okay.
