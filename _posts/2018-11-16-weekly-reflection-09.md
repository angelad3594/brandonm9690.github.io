This week we learned about values versus functions definitions and how to model situations. There is a difference between a value and a function is that values don't change if you don't want them to. That is pretty much what we learned this whole week was how to model situations such as the rocket blasting off and explaining what we would like to know. Today we learned about a function that was ```;gt:Number-->Image``` which is a fenced code block. I would really like to learn more about this because it sounds interesting and Mr. Allatta just introduced it to us this morning so i had decided to put this in my blog.
