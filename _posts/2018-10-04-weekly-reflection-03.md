So  in this week we learned about contacts so that computers can understand what to to do so what we do is give what they expect and they give back what we expect.
This to me is exciting because we get to learn so much more about the web and how most things on a browser are formed.
The hardest thing I found difficult was that since in the notes it was pretty difficult to understand because most of the things werent necessary.
