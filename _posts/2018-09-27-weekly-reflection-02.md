  So in our classes with Mr. Allatta we our learning to make a video game that is short and easy for us beginners in programming such as me.
In class, I am able to understand most of the things because its explained very thoroughly most of the time.
Like I said before, we are learning about how to program and create a videogame and things about racket scheme.
The struggles that I mostly face are that its pretty difficult to jus program in general since all we've been doing is copying and pasting.
