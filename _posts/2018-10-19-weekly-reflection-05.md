In this week we learned alot in CS which was pretty much doing things like making a flag and combining many shapes so that the flag would appear and be presented it was pretty stressful because most of the time the flag wouldn't appear how it was meant to look like in the Germany flag since there are three colors which are red, orange, and black it was hard to do the put-image for it. In the end it was pretty fun since I had many friends help out with the problems I had. Also I hope to learn more in this class so that in the future I can use this.
