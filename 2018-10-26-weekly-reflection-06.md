So in this 1/3 of a semester we learned mostly about computer science and how html pages and other types of coding programs work, such as wescheme, css,and github pages for our blogs. In github pages alot of work must go into it to just make the website actually show on a tab. We also learned about circles of evaluation which help in evaluating expressions in order. There is also "contracts" which gives the computer info it expects and gives back what you expect from it.There are many contracts like image function contracts which allow like the name states for images to show. We upgraded our blogs as well so that they would be a bit more in depth as to what we are learning in class. With all this we ended up putting it together to form a game of sort with our partners in pair programming so that it would be faster to get to finish the game. We also learned about value definitions and game images which helped to make the game a bit more easier so that many things in the game could show up. I've found many things in making the game difficult because it wouldn't show the image in wesheme which didn't allow me and my partner to continue in making the game. But it's only 1/3 of the semester which means we have a good amount of time to make the game and to learn a bit more of computer science.
